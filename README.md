# Theraot.ECS

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yny5hsrbjc7asfud?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/theraot/theraot-ecs)

A flexible pure C# Entity-Component-System solution.

You can specify the types used for:

- Entity Ids (e.g. `int`, `Guid`, etc...).
- Component Values (whatever you need, they do not need in herit from anything, have a particular interface, or be struct).
- Containers of Component Values (intended to allow special containers, such as quadtrees). Must implement `IIntKeyCollection`.
- Component Kinds (e.g. `int`, `string`, etc...).
- Sets of Component Kinds (e.g. to use bit arrays for quick comparison of sets).

Systems? This solution, despite being called ECS, does not store systems. Create your systems whatever way you want.

Note: `Component Kinds` and `Sets of Component Kinds` are changed togheter, by providing an implementation of `IComponentKindManager`.

Basic usage example
---

    // Creates a new scope, the entity id type will be Guid, the component kind will be int, the component kind set is FlagArray
    // The default containers of component values will be used
    // Only 2 component kinds are allowed
    var scope = Scope.CreateScope(EqualityComparer<Guid>.Default, new FlagArrayManager(2));

    // These will be our component kinds
    const int first = 0;
    const int second = 1;

    // Create an entity id
    var entityId = Guid.NewGuid();
    // Register the entity in the scope
    scope.RegisterEntity(entityId);
    // Store an string "World" in the component kind 0 of the entity
    scope.SetComponent(entityId, first, "World");

    // Create an EntityCollection for all the entities that have component kind 1
    var entities = scope.GetEntityCollection(all: new[] { second }, any: Array.Empty<int>(), none: Array.Empty<int>());
    // Register a notification when new components satisfy the query
    entities.AddedEntity += (sender, args) =>
    {
        // Execute a callback on the entity
        scope.With
        (
            args.EntityId,
            second,
            (Guid _, ref string componentValue) => Console.WriteLine(componentValue)
        );
    };

    // Add a string "Hello" in the component kind 1 of the entity
    scope.SetComponent(entityId, second, "Hello");

    // Recover the component we set earlier
    Console.WriteLine(scope.GetComponent<string>(entityId, first));

Design decisions
---

- The ECS allows to specify the type used to represent component ids. As a useful side effect, it does not generate entity ids, which is useful if you want to synchronize entities across the network.

- The ECS uses component kinds. There can be multiple component kinds with the same type. *For example, a speed component can be `Vector2` and a position component can also be `Vector2`.* A type is registered for each component type, either explicitly with `Scope.TryRegisterType` (which fails if it is already registered) or implicitly with the first call of `Scope.SetComponent` that uses the component type. Type safety is kept for the registered type of the component kind. This also allows optimizations when handling sets of component kinds.

- The ECS allows to specify a class that handle component kinds and sets of component kinds. This is done by passing a type that implements `IComponentKindManager` when creating a `Scope`. Two implementations of that interface are provided:

   1. `FlagArrayManager` which represents component types as integers, and stores them as binary flags. Initially I wanted to use `BitArray`, however it was sub optimal for comparing sets. Instead I wrote a more versatile `FlagArray` class. This is intended to be fast by taking advantage of bit-wise operations. Comparison complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of all existing component kinds in the `Scope`. Use this when the number of component kinds is known and small.
   2. `SetManager` which represents component types as strings, and stores them in hash based sets (`HashSet<string>` except in .NET 2.0 and .NET 3.0 where it uses a custom internal set type). This is intended to have flat performance. Complexity on comparison is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of component kinds of the entity. Use this while the number of component kinds is still unknown, once it is settled, you may consider to switch to `FlagArrayManager` and see if it improves performance.

   Note: storing the component kinds as constants in a static class instead of leaving them as magic values is encouraged.

- The ECS keeps tracks of the created queries, this means that after the first time, getting the entities that match a query (`Scope.GetEntityCollection`) is an `O(1)` operation. The first time it is `O(n)` when `n` is the number of matched entities. Therefore it is recommended to make the needed calls to `Scope.GetEntityCollection` before registering entities.

- The ECS, by default, keeps components nearby in memory by their type, instead of by their entity. Because it allows to specify custom containers for particular types via `Scope.TryRegisterType` (which will fail is components of that type has already been added), which is useful for example, to handle components in a space aware data structure (e.g. a quadtree). This is done by passing an implementation of `IIntKeyCollection` to `Scope.TryRegisterType`, the only implementation provided is `IntKeyCollection` which is used by default.

- The ECS provides temporary ref access to components, this allows fast read and write of them. To get them use `Scope.With` or `EntityCollection.ForEach` which take callbacks with ref parameters. While the flow of execution is inside the callbacks, all addition or removals of components are buffered, because they could move the referenced components. *There are no guarantees about taking pointers from these references.*

- The ECS is not thread-safe. Since the components are arranged by their type and not by entity, it is not feasible to lock an entity. This only leaves the options of locking by component or locking the whole. Locking by component would have meant a noticeable performance penalty, and locking the whole is better handled outside of the library.

- The ECS provides events that notify when a component was added or removed. This was actually necessary to be able to buffer changes… since the changes can happen at a later moment from the call, a notification was necessary to update the component kind sets internally… it was minimal extra effort to make these events public.
